# Contributing to yuman-ea

Thanks for your interest in contributing. yuman-ea is a community effort to build a framework of AI agents and skills for Enterprise Architecture — contributions of all sizes are welcome, from typo fixes to new agents.

## Ways to contribute

- **Report a bug or gap** — open an [issue](../../issues) with what you expected vs. what happened.
- **Propose a new agent or skill** — open an issue using the "Agent/Skill proposal" template (or describe: the EA activity it supports, inputs/outputs, and how it fits Business Architecture / Technology Architecture / Portfolio Management).
- **Improve documentation** — README, examples, and agent/skill docs always need work.
- **Submit code** — pick up an open issue, or discuss a new one first before starting significant work.

## Development workflow

1. Fork the repo and create a branch off `main`: `git checkout -b feature/short-description`
2. Make your changes, keeping commits focused and messages descriptive.
3. Add or update tests/examples where relevant.
4. Ensure existing tests and linting pass locally.
5. Open a pull request against `main`, describing what changed and why. Link any related issue.

## Adding a new agent or skill

To keep the framework consistent:

- Place new agents under `agents/<agent-name>/` and new skills under `skills/<skill-name>/`.
- Include a short README in the agent/skill folder covering: purpose, inputs, outputs, and example usage.
- Map the agent/skill to one (or more) of the three pillars: Business Architecture, Technology Architecture, Portfolio Management.
- Avoid hard dependencies on a specific vendor/tool where possible — favor configurable interfaces.

(Exact folder structure and interface conventions are still being finalized — check open issues/discussions for the latest before large contributions.)

## Pull request review

- PRs are reviewed by maintainers; expect feedback or requested changes.
- Small, focused PRs get reviewed faster than large ones.
- Be responsive to review comments — PRs inactive for 30+ days may be closed and can be reopened later.
